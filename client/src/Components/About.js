        <p>Flexible, adaptable Full Stack Developer with proficiency in Python, JavaScript, React, and Ruby. I've created Chat-Bots with programs like Python and fully functional web apps using React JS. I've learned how to implement a working backend environment using Node.JS and MongoDB in a few personal and school projects.I love coding because I enjoy the freedom that comes from creating a project from the ground up or even tackling an assigned group project with fellow coders, improving the functionality of an already established project. Tech is so compelling to me because itâ€™s a fast-growing and ever-changing industry with an endless capacity to learn. This fuels my curious and ambitious nature to improve my coding skills while executing whatever task is given to me.
            My second passion in life is traveling around the world and experiencing new cultures. Growing up in a multicultural city such as New York City played a major part in my fearlessness of hopping on a plane and traveling to new destinations. Meeting people from all walks of life, opening up my horizon to see the world from a different point of view. .
